                <br>
                Master Ping Pong is a wild and awesome version of Ping Pong.
                This new epic variation of Ping Pong only requires a Ping Pong
                ball and a paddle. Read the rules and play some games together.
                Whoever has won the most games after that is declared Grandmaster.
                The Grandmaster is the ultimate champion!

            <h2>How to play</h2>
            <p>
                Master Ping Pong is very different than regular Ping Pong. To start off, one player hits the ball to th
            e other player. The only thing that registers this hit valid is that it leaves your circle. Your circle is an imaginary circle around you. The player then has to hit the ball out of their circle in response. If the flow is stopped, the opponent of the person who messses up gains a point. If the ball just stops, like if it hits a carpet and stops bouncing, and the ball previously bounced outside the sender's circle, the sender gets a point. Otherwise, no point is awarded.
